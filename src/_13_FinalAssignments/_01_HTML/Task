📝 Objective:
Recreate the university response letter shown in the provided image using HTML.

📷 Reference Image:

📌 Instructions:

1. Use a proper HTML5 structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
2. Use inline CSS styles or `align="right"` where necessary for alignment.
3. Add Dr. Eleanor Gaye’s contact info to the top-right corner (name, faculty, university, address, phone, email, date).
4. Add Miss Eileen Dover’s address to the top-left under the sender’s info.
5. Use a heading (`<h1>`) for the subject:
   `Re: Eileen Dover university application`
6. Use `<p>` elements for each paragraph of the letter body.
7. Use `<ul>` and `<li>` for the list of semester start dates.
8. Apply emphasis using `<b>` and `<i>` tags where appropriate.
9. Use `<br>` tags only where line breaks are necessary within a paragraph.

🔎 Notes:
- Mind the grammar and spacing.
- Keep the formatting as close as possible to the provided reference image (`image.png`).
- You are NOT allowed to use external CSS or JS in this task. Inline styling only.
